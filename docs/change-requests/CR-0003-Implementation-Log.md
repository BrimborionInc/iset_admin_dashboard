# CR-0003 – Financial Administration & Reporting Module  
_Implementation Log & Chat Handoff Notes_

## 1. Purpose
Track progress, decisions, and outstanding work for the CR-0003 implementation. Use this document to resume work across chat sessions without re-reading the full change request.

## 2. Current Scope Snapshot
* **Side navigation** – `Financial Management` section scaffolded with eight dashboard links (`finance/overview`, `budgets`, `allocations`, `reconciliation`, `reports`, `monitoring`, `forecasting`, `settings`).
* **Routing** – Placeholder pages created in `src/pages/finance/` with breadcrumb wiring and guards in `src/routes/AppRoutes.js`.
* **Access control** – Finance routes added to `src/config/roleMatrix.json`, surfaced in `AccessControlMatrix`, and merged automatically with server state via `mergeWithBaseRoutes` in `RoleMatrixContext`.
* **UI** – Each finance page renders a `FinancePlaceholder` container (title + short description), no functional widgets yet.

## 3. Completed Work (latest session)
| Date (UTC) | Item | Files |
|------------|------|-------|
| 2025-10-18 | Added nav section and finance route stubs | `src/layouts/SideNavigation.js`, `src/routes/AppRoutes.js`, `src/pages/finance/*` |
| 2025-10-18 | Updated role matrix defaults + Access Control labels | `src/config/roleMatrix.json`, `src/context/RoleMatrixContext.js`, `src/widgets/AccessControlMatrix.jsx` |

## 4. Outstanding Tasks
1. **Build actual dashboards** – Replace placeholder containers with real Cloudscape layouts per Section 10 of CR-0003.
2. **Data plumbing** – Define API clients/services for budgets, transactions, evidence, reports, monitoring, forecasting.
3. **State & context** – Decide shared store (React context, Zustand, Redux?) for finance data and integrate with existing layout state.
4. **Role granularity** – Confirm if Finance sub-roles are required (e.g., read-only auditors) and extend role matrix if so.
5. **Telemetry & logging** – Hook up `agreement_id`/`report_id` events per CR guidance.
6. **Testing** – Plan integration/unit tests once real functionality lands.

## 5. Open Questions / Dependencies
* Do program partners require separate access to sub-agreement dashboards, or will they continue using existing portals?
* Which API endpoints are already available for finance data versus those that must be implemented?
* Confirm design system assets (icons, board widgets) for finance KPIs—reuse existing board layout or move to page templates?

## 6. Next Suggested Steps
1. Align on data model and APIs (sync with backend / database schema).
2. Prioritize which dashboards go live first (e.g., Overview + Reports) and draft wireframes.
3. Convert placeholders into real components, starting with overview KPI cards.

## 7. Notes for Future Sessions
* When loading in a real environment, verify the server-side role matrix has been refreshed (Access Control → “Restore defaults”) so finance routes appear without local overrides.
* Keep an eye on line endings (repo mixes CRLF/LF in some files); stick to UTF-8 via `apply_patch` or Python scripts.
* If tokens are tight, reference this log plus the original CR (`docs/change-requests/CR-0003-Financial Module.md`) for requirement details.
